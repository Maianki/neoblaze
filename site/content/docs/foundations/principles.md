## Design Principles {.heading-xs .mt-6 .mb-2}

The operating philosophy behind Neoblaze CSS is rooted in the belief that design should be judged by its visual impact. We understand that design is a subjective matter and what may look beautiful to one person may not appeal to another. That's why we've taken a data-driven approach to the development of our CSS, conducting extensive research to ensure that our styles are visually pleasing to the majority.

But research is only one part of the equation. The other, more important part is the designer's eye. We believe that design should be evaluated based on its ability to evoke emotion and communicate a message, rather than adhering to a set of rigid rules.

We have crafted Neoblaze CSS carefully to provide a set of styles that are easy to use, customizable, and visually pleasing. The result is a framework that is responsive, adaptable, and a great tool that makes web design effortless and enjoyable.

"Judge a design with your eyes" is our ultimate goal and judge of the design.
